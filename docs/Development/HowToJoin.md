# IoTDB R&D Beginning
## Subscribe to the mailing list (dev@iotdb.apache.org)
What we want to build is an international open source community. The mailing list is the only communication channel that Apache designates for open source contributors. So try to make all plans and routes public on the mailing list. The subscription method is as follows:

 1. Sending subscription email: Send an email to [dev-subscribe@iotdb.apache.org](dev-subscribe@iotdb.apache.org) with any subject you want.
 2. Confirming subscription: You will receive a subscription confirmation email from iotdb.apache.org after completing the previous step. Confirm your subscription by sending another email to this email with any subject matter.

## Create a development platform account

 1. Creating Jira account: [https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/IOTDB/issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/IOTDB/issues) in order to claim issues.
 2. Creating Confluence account: [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/IOTDB/Home](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/IOTDB/Home) . It is then used to write design documents.

After creation, please send an email to the mailing list including **self introduction**, **Jira ID** and **Confluence ID**. The community PMC will add permissions to the account.

## Enter user/development chat group
Users in China use QQ and WeChat a lot. This is the place where the interaction with the community is closest, and it is also our front line.

 - QQ user group: 659990460
 - WeChat user group: IoTDB 数据库交流x群
 - WeChat developer group: IoTDB Community
 - Slack: [Apache IoTDB Community](https://join.slack.com/t/apacheiotdb/shared_invite/zt-qvso1nj8-7715TpySZtZqmyG5qXQwpg)
